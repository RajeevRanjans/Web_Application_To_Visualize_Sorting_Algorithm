# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithms Visualizer web application! This interactive tool allows you to explore and understand the inner workings of various sorting algorithms through colorful visualizations. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this application is designed to help you grasp the concepts of sorting algorithms with ease.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

## Features

### Color-coded Representation

We've incorporated a dynamic color scheme to enhance your understanding of the sorting process:

- **Blue**: Default state
- **Yellow**: Elements currently being compared
- **Red**: Elements identified as being in the incorrect position and needing to be moved
- **Green**: Elements in the correct position

### Visualization Controls

1. **Speed of Visualization**: Choose from five different speed levels to control how fast the sorting algorithm visualizations occur.
2. **Data Size**: Adjust the data size to observe how algorithms perform with varying amounts of data.
3. **Generate New Data**: Easily generate new random data sets for experimentation.

### Time and Space Complexity

Each algorithm visualization comes with a clear display of its time and space complexity. This insight helps you understand the efficiency of the algorithms and make informed choices based on specific use cases.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.
3. Select the sorting algorithm you want to visualize from the list.
4. Adjust the visualization controls (speed and data size) according to your preference.
5. Watch the algorithm in action and observe how the elements move and rearrange.
